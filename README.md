As the mod enabled to build far bigger industries -particularly minor countries- while also reducing the cost of production of tanks, it is now possible to produce to produce things like full armies of dirt cheap super-heavy tanks or an Atlantikwall manned by tanks on every ports...

This submod intend to rebalance the mod, going back to micromanage a few quality divisions instead of having to battleplan with whole armies of armored divisions.
