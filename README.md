# Scuffed Rebalanced

Rebalance of the Heart of Iron IV's mod RT56 Scuffed


As the mod enabled to build far bigger industries -particularly minor countries- while also reducing the cost of production of tanks, it is now difficult to play without having full armies of dirt cheap super-heavy tanks.
This submod intend to rebalance the mod, going back to micromanage a few quality divisions instead of having to battleplan with whole armies of armored divisions.
